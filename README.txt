Codes needed to run each question: 

Question 2-4: 	Q2_5.R -> Graph and MST from daily data & process

Question 5: 	Q2_5.R -> Output double MST graph edge list (.csv) to python to find Euler Tour and compute TSP from outputted python file
	    	Q5.py -> Create graph from .csv Perform Euler Tour
			FindEulerTour.py -> Euler Tour function provided
		Q2_5.R -> TSP.txt opened in R and TSP is found.  For simplicity TSP.txt is already included so Q5.py does not need to be 			run to run all the code.

Question 6: 	Q6.R -> Graph and MST from only monday data

Question 7: 	Q7.R -> Modified graph and MST from daily data
